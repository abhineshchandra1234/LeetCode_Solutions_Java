/**
 * 2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * As evident in the question, we will store losses of each player in a hashmap
 * whether it is winner or loser
 * Then we will just traverse its key set which contain both winner and loser
 * player
 * Then based on losscount add each player to respective lists at 0 and 1 index.
 * losscount is 0, player will be added in list at index 0
 * losscount is 1, player will be added in list at index 1
 * Since we need players in sorted order we have used treemap which will sort
 * all keys in hashmap ie winner and loser players
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(nâˆ—logn), sorting players in hashmap
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(n), storing players in hashmap
 *
