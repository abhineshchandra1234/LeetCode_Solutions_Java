/**
 * 238. Product of Array Except Self
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * credits dead_lock
 * Brute Force
 * First Approach - For each no we will find product of all nos except self
 * using two loops
 * TC - O(n^2)
 * Second Approach - Find product of all nos then for each no just divide
 * product with self
 * TC - O(n)
 * Optimal Approach
 * First Approach - take two arrays to store prefix product and suffix product
 * for each index
 * Traverse array from left to right find prefix product for each index and
 * store in prefix product array
 * Similarly calculate suffix product by traversing array from right to left
 * Then again traverse array and for each no res would be product of prefix and
 * suffix
 * TC - O(n), SC - O(n)
 * Second Approach - Same prefix and suffix principal is followed
 * Find prefix using var curr and store in res array by traversing array from
 * left to right
 * Find suffix by reseting var curr and multiplying it in res to get final value
 * by traversing array from right to left.
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(1)
