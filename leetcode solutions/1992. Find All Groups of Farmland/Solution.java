/**
 * 1992. Find All Groups of Farmland
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * we can solve this problem through dfs or bfs
 * To reduce complexity solved it through greedy
 * we will traverse through matrix, if we found water we will skip it
 * If we found land we find its farthest column using col ptr and farthest row
 * using ro ptr
 * Then we will add 4 coordinates to res
 * Then we will mark the whole group as water or 0 using 4 coordinates, to avoid
 * repetition
 * 
 * Approach
 * 
 * we have marked group water after calculating farthest row and col, if we had
 * done it simultaneously it would have given error for next computation.
 * we have used a list of int array, as we cannot convert list of Integer object
 * to int array
 * 
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(mâˆ—n)
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(1)
 *
