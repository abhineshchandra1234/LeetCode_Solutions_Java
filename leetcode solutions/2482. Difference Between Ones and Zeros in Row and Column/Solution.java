/**
 * 2482. Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * By the question it is clear that we can solve it in place by using 4 arrays
 * to store count of zeros and ones for each rol and col
 * how to optimize it, we can solve it just by using 2 arrays to store count of
 * ones for each row and col
 * Next 2 arrays can be calculated from the existing arrays
 * rowZeros[i] = cols - rowOnes[i]
 * colZeros[j] = rows - colOnes[j]
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(mâˆ—n)
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(m+n)
 *
