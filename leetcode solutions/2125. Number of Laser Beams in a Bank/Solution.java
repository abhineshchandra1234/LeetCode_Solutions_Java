/**
 * 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * we will solve this problem using greedy approach and using two ptrs curr &
 * prev
 * curr will keep track of lasers in curr row and similarly prev will track
 * lasers in prev row
 * if total lasers in curr row is greater than 0 then update ans += prev * curr;
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(mâˆ—n)
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(1)
