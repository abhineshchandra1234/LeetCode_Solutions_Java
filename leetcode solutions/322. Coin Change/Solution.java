/**
 * 322. Coin Change
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * As evident in the question we will solve this problem through dp
 * We will start from base amount 0 and use that to compute rest of the amount
 * No of coins fro ith amount, will be equal to min of curr value and 1 + curr
 * value - c, where c is the coin less than the amount
 * dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - c]);
 * we can construct any amount by adding a suitable coin to previous amount
 * Finally we will return coins at dp[amount]
 * If max no of coins were asked just replace Math.min with Math.max
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(nâˆ—k), for every amount we are traversing each
 * coin
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(n), we are storing min coins for each amount
 *

                    break;
                if (dp[i - c] != Integer.MAX_VALUE)
