/**
 * 948. Bag of Tokens
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * credits lee215
 * to get the max score we need to buy token at cheapest and sell at highest
 * so we will sort tokens based on price, and use two ptrs start will be used to
 * buy tokens at cheapest rates and end will be used to sell tokens at highest
 * rates
 * we cannot use visted tokens
 * we will first try to buy tokens
 * if we cannot buy then we would try to sell tokens
 * If we cannot do both ie we have exhuasted all the resources, we will return
 * the max score
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(nâˆ—logn), sort
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(logn), sort
 *
