/**
 * 1897. Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * credits lancertech6
 * the approach is simple we need to find freq of each chars and check if can we
 * can distribute it equally in all words
 * Few more checks can be done before above for faster computation
 * If there is a single word return true
 * Count total chars and check if it can be re-distributed equally.
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(nâˆ—k), n words with k avg length
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(1)
 *
