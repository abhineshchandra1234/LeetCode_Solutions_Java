/**
 * 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
 * 
 * Intuition
 * we are given string s, we need to return minimum no of deletion to make s
 * balanced
 * 
 * Approach
 * we can easily solve this problem through stack, through simulation
 * the deletion count will increase if top is b and curr is a, b will be popped
 * time and space will be O(n)
 * the next approach is using dynamic programming
 * we can delete curr a, so that prefix end with b, one valid condition
 * or we can delete entire b encountered so far, so that there is no b before a,
 * second valid condition
 * our goal is to have all b's after a's
 * 
 * Complexity
 * Time complexity: O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
