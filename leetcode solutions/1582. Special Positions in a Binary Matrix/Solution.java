/**
 * 1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix
 * 
 * Intuition
 * 
 * As it is evident in the question we will first check which row and col
 * contain 1
 * then again we will traverse the matrix, if we found 1 and its row and col
 * contain only 0s or no other 1. then we got one suitable ans.
 * the question is how to store 1 pos, for that we will use two arrays one of
 * size row and another of size col.
 * 
 * Approach
 * Complexity
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(mâˆ—n)
 * 
 * Space complexity: O(m+n)
 *
