/**
 * 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower
 * 
 * Intuition
 * We can solve this using dp as there is choice involved either to pick or
 * leave.
 * For each index we have two options
 * we can collect points of curr index and skip next
 * brainpoweribrainpower_ibrainpower
 * i
 * â€‹
 * indexes
 * we can skip curr index and select next index
 * we will assign max of above two values to each index
 * each dp[i] will represent max points from i to n
 * we will return result at dp[0]
 * 
 * Approach
 * Math.min(i+jump+1,n)
 * used above to avoid out of bounds
 * 
 * Complexity
 * Time complexity: O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(n)
